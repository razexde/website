                    Razex.de is a community that is active since 2014 and offers free hosting services for members.
                    Originally we were founded in Frankfurt am Main in Germany and began as an amateur e-sport group playing in different games.
                    Since then we had our own community TeamSpeak server, offering private voice channels for everyone.
                    After we decided to switch to a self-managed linux server, we started providing shared game servers for free.
                    <br /><br />
                    Years have passed by and the e-sport group is not existing anymore. 
                    What was left was the server infrastructure, so we changed the focus and began to mainly offer free webhosting.
                    Over time we developed into a hosting company which is actually not a company.
                    <br /><br />
                    Razex.de is part of Codebucket.de and all related sites, owned by David Sn.
